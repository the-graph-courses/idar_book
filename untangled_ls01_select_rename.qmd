## Introduction

Today we will begin our exploration of the {dplyr} package! Our first verb on the list is `select` which allows to keep or drop variables from your dataframe. Choosing your variables is the first step in cleaning your data.

Let's go !

## Learning objectives

-   You can keep or drop columns from a dataframe using the `dplyr::select()` function from the {dplyr} package.

-   You can select a range or combination of columns using operators like the colon (`:`), the exclamation mark (`!`), and the `c()` function.

-   You can select columns based on patterns in their names with helper functions like `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, `contains()`, and `everything()`.

-   You can use `rename()` and `select()` to change column names.

## The Yaounde COVID-19 dataset

In this lesson, we analyse results from a COVID-19 serological survey conducted in Yaounde, Cameroon in late 2020. The survey estimated how many people had been infected with COVID-19 in the region, by testing for IgG and IgM antibodies. The full dataset can be obtained from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5218965){target="_blank"}, and the paper can be viewed [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25946-0){target="_blank"}.

Spend some time browsing through this dataset. Each line corresponds to one patient surveyed. There are some demographic, socio-economic and COVID-related variables. The results of the IgG and IgM antibody tests are in the columns `igg_result` and `igm_result`.

```{r, message = F, render = head_5_rows}
yaounde <- read_csv(here::here("data/yaounde_data.csv"))
yaounde  
```

## Introducing `select()`

![Fig: the `select()` function. (Drawing adapted from Allison Horst).](images/final_dplyr_select.png){width="408"}

`dplyr::select()` lets us pick which columns (variables) to keep or drop.

We can select a column **by name**:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
yaounde %>% select(age) 
```

Or we can select a column **by position**:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
yaounde %>% select(3) # `age` is the 3rd column
```

To select **multiple variables**, we separate them with commas:

```{r}
yaounde %>% select(age, sex, igg_result)
```

::: {.callout-tip title='Practice'}
-   Select the weight and height variables in the `yaounde` data frame.

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
## For this first question we'll provide the answer. Your code should be:

Q_weight_height <- yaounde %>% select(weight_kg, height_cm)
## Run that line, then run the CHECK and HINT functions below

.CHECK_Q_weight_height()
.HINT_Q_weight_height()

## Now, to obtain the solution, run the line below!
.SOLUTION_Q_weight_height()
## Each question has a solution function similar to this (.SOLUTION_Q_xxx_xxx())
## But you will need to type out the function name on your own.
## (This is to discourage you from looking at the solution before answering the question.)
```

-   Select the 16th and 22nd columns in the `yaounde` data frame.

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_cols_16_22 <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE" 
.CHECK_Q_cols_16_22()
.HINT_Q_cols_16_22()
```
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the next part of the tutorial, let's create a smaller subset of the data, called `yao`.

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
yao <-
  yaounde %>% select(age,
                     sex,
                     highest_education,
                     occupation,
                     is_smoker,
                     is_pregnant,
                     igg_result,
                     igm_result)
yao
```

### Selecting column ranges with `:`

The `:` operator selects a **range of consecutive variables**:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
yao %>% select(age:occupation) # Select all columns from `age` to `occupation`
```

We can also specify a range with column numbers:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
yao %>% select(1:4) # Select columns 1 to 4
```

::: {.callout-tip title='Practice'}
-   With the `yaounde` data frame, select the columns between `symptoms` and `sequelae`, inclusive. ("Inclusive" means you should also include `symptoms` and `sequelae` in the selection.)

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_symp_to_sequel <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"  
.CHECK_Q_symp_to_sequel()
.HINT_Q_symp_to_sequel()
```
:::

### Excluding columns with `!`

The **exclamation point** negates a selection:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
yao %>% select(!age) # Select all columns except `age`
```

To drop a range of consecutive columns, we use, for example,`!age:occupation`:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
yao %>% select(!age:occupation) # Drop columns from `age` to `occupation`
```

To drop several non-consecutive columns, place them inside `!c()`:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
yao %>% select(!c(age, sex, igg_result))
```

::: {.callout-tip title='Practice'}
-   From the `yaounde` data frame, **remove** all columns between `highest_education` and `consultation`, inclusive.

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_educ_consult <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE" 
.CHECK_Q_educ_consult()
.HINT_Q_educ_consult()
```
:::

## Helper functions for `select()`

`dplyr` has a number of helper functions to make selecting easier by using patterns from the column names. Let's take a look at some of these.

### `starts_with()` and `ends_with()`

These two helpers work exactly as their names suggest!

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
yao %>% select(starts_with("is_")) # Columns that start with "is"
yao %>% select(ends_with("_result")) # Columns that end with "result"
```

### `contains()`

`contains()` helps select columns that contain a certain string:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
yaounde %>% select(contains("drug")) # Columns that contain the string "drug"
```

### `everything()`

Another helper function, `everything()`, matches all variables that have not yet been selected.

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
## First, `is_pregnant`, then every other column.
yao %>% select(is_pregnant, everything())
```

It is often useful for establishing the order of columns.

Say we wanted to bring the `is_pregnant` column to the start of the `yao` data frame, we could type out all the column names manually:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
yao %>% select(is_pregnant, 
               age, 
               sex, 
               highest_education, 
               occupation, 
               is_smoker, 
               igg_result, 
               igm_result)
```

But this would be painful for larger data frames, such as our original `yaounde` data frame. In such a case, we can use `everything()`:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
## Bring `is_pregnant` to the front of the data frame
yaounde %>% select(is_pregnant, everything())
```

This helper can be combined with many others.

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
## Bring columns that end with "result" to the front of the data frame
yaounde %>% select(ends_with("result"), everything())
```

::: {.callout-tip title='Practice'}
-   Select all columns in the `yaounde` data frame that start with "is\_".

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_starts_with_is <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"  
.CHECK_Q_starts_with_is()
.HINT_Q_starts_with_is()
```

-   Move the columns that start with "is\_" to the beginning of the `yaounde` data frame.

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_rearrange <- "YOUR ANSWER HERE"  
.CHECK_Q_rearrange()
.HINT_Q_rearrange()
```
:::

## Change column names with `rename()`

![Fig: the `rename()` function. (Drawing adapted from Allison Horst)](images/dplyr_rename.png)

[`dplyr::rename()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/rename.html) is used to change column names:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
## Rename `age` and `sex` to `patient_age` and `patient_sex`
yaounde %>% 
  rename(patient_age = age, 
         patient_sex = sex)
```

::: {.callout-caution title='Watch Out'}
The fact that the new name comes first in the function (`rename(NEWNAME = OLDNAME)`) is sometimes confusing. You should get used to this with time.
:::

### Rename within `select()`

You can also rename columns while selecting them:

```{r, render = head_5_rows}
## Select `age` and `sex`, and rename them to `patient_age` and `patient_sex`
yaounde %>% 
  select(patient_age = age, 
         patient_sex = sex)
```

## Wrap up

I hope this first lesson has allowed you to see how intuitive and useful the {dplyr} verbs are! This is the first of a series of basic data wrangling verbs: see you in the next lesson to learn more.
